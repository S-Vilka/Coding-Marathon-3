# Usage

### Part 1

1. **Install Backend Dependencies**  
   
   - Navigate to the `backend-no-auth` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the backend directory.   
   ```sh
   cd backend-no-auth 
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies & Start the App**  
   Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the application:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the App**  
   Open your browser and visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   

### Part 2


   - Stop the server, if it is running.
   - Navigate to the `backend-auth` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the backend directory.
   ```sh
   cd backend-auth 
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Part 3

  

   - Stop the server, if it is running.
   - Navigate to the `backend-protected` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the backend directory.
   ```sh
   cd backend-protected 
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Assessment

Your backend code is well-structured and follows good practices. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

#### Strengths:
- **Modular Structure:** Your code is organized into separate files for routes, controllers, models, and middleware, which enhances readability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling:** You have implemented error handling in your controllers, which is crucial for debugging and user experience.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication is implemented, which is a secure way to handle user sessions.
- **Validation:** Basic validation is present in the user signup and login processes.
- **Testing:** You have included unit tests for user and job routes, which is excellent for ensuring code reliability.

#### Areas for Improvement:

**Validation:**
- **User Input Validation:** Consider using a library like Joi or express-validator to validate user inputs more robustly.
- **Job Input Validation:** Similarly, validate job inputs to ensure data integrity.

**Error Handling:**
- **Consistent Error Responses:** Ensure that all error responses follow a consistent format. This makes it easier for the frontend to handle errors.
- **Custom Error Classes:** Create custom error classes to handle different types of errors more gracefully.

**Security:**
- **Password Strength:** Ensure that passwords meet certain complexity requirements.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Helmet:** Use the helmet middleware to set various HTTP headers for security.

**Code Duplication:**
- **DRY Principle:** Avoid code duplication, especially in error handling and response formatting. Create utility functions where necessary.

**Environment Variables:**
- **Sensitive Information:** Ensure that sensitive information like JWT secrets and database URIs are stored securely and not hard-coded.

**Database Connection:**
- **Connection Handling:** Ensure that the database connection is properly handled, especially in test environments. Consider using `mongoose.disconnect()` in your `afterAll` hooks.

#### Specific Suggestions:

**User Controller:**
- In `signupUser`, the `profile_picture` field is optional, but your validation requires it. Adjust the validation accordingly.
- Use `async/await` consistently and handle all possible exceptions.

**Job Controller:**
- In `createJob`, validate the job data before creating a new job.
- In `updateJob`, ensure that only allowed fields are updated to prevent accidental overwrites.

**Testing:**
- Add more tests to cover edge cases and error scenarios.
- Use `jest` or another testing framework to mock database operations for more isolated tests.

**Middleware:**
- Enhance the `requireAuth` middleware to handle token expiration and other JWT-related errors more gracefully.
